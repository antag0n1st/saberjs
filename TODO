- fix visibilty issue on iphone , https://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility-2/

- manage history state in order to make the back button work for android.
- auto import view component when a valid name is typed. , maybe it can be solved by reimporting the entire work file. ( a refresh function )


# CLIENT

- add PWA manifest and service worker
- on release create a service working that caches all assets
- add option to ignore PWA creation ( no manifest , no service worker ) , this is for the release script
- add icons for instalation , set default favicon , set icons in the index.html
- add meta tags for social in the index.html
- when installing , ask for release url default to local , then use the url when creating the release , usefull to generate PWA
- on install ask for the PWA parameters , like short name of the app. the PWA config is better to be a file that can be reused with the release script ( release.config )
- ignore icons , don't load them as assets
- use a command line tool https://imagemagick.org/index.php , to process resizing of icons
